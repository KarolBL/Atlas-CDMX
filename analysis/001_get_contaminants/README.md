# Get contaminants

## Idea

Use ``aire.zmvm`` to gather:

- Contaminant stations
- Contaminants: SO2, CO, NO2, NO, NOX, O3, PM10 and PM25.
- IMECA index
- Temperature
- Relative Humidity
- Wind: Speed and Direction
- Time span: 2009‑01‑01 up to 2018 by hour

## Goal

Parallel independent data contaminants,temp and wind outputs + station location
- Independent result files per contaminats and so on.

## Requirements

R package: ``aire.zmvm``
